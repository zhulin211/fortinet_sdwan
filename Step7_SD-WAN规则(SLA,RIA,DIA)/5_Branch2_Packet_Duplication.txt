Advanced Options:

duplication-max-num: 3 (默认2)

[官方解释]
On the spoke, duplication-max-num is set to 3. This instructs FortiGate to forward up to three copies of the packet—the original packet plus two duplicates. Moreover, each copy is sent through a different member.

Packet Duplication: Force

[官方解释 Packet Duplication]
On the spoke, packet-duplication is set to force, which instructs FortiGate to always duplicate packets.
An alternative is to set packet-duplication to on-demand, which instructs FortiGate to duplicate packets based on the SLA status of the outgoing interface.

Packet Duplication: On Demand

Advanced Options:
sla-match-service: enable

[官方解释 匹配Service]
You can configure packet duplication rules to duplicate packets that match one or more SD-WAN rules.
This enables you to have more granular control and flexibility over duplicated traffic,
as well as reduce the configuration required. For example, you can leverage the application steering feature
of SD-WAN rules to duplicate traffic based on the detected application,
rather than using the fixed 5-tuple configuration on a duplication rule to identify the traffic.
Similarly, you can leverage ISDB and route tags to identify the destination of the traffic to duplicate.
